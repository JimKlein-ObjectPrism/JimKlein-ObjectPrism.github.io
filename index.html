<p>The Kartini Meal Plan Food Journal App was created for the internationally-known, Portland-based Kartini clinic, which specializes in treating eating disorders in adolescents.</p>
<p>
It helps support a patient’s ordered eating by streamlining reporting for parents of patients.  It also can help in building the habits of a lifetime of ordered eating for patients by providing a way to track meals after leaving treatment.
</p>
<p>
It is available for Beta Testing in TestFlight.
</p>
<p>This release of the app contains these features:</p>
<li><strong>Home screen:</strong>  Time-of-day aware quick link to the appropriate meal.</li>
<li><strong>Track screen:</strong>  Access, enter, and edit all meals for the current day and any previous days.</li>
<li><strong>Print screen:</strong>  Print out the food journal log entry for a selected day.  Or use the print preview to quickly review details for any day.</li>
<li><strong>Profile screen:</strong>  Enables setup of patient, parents, required snacks, Medicines, and Addons.</li>
